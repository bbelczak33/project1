This project was created by Ben Belczak, Molly Delehant, Joseph DeVito, Matthew Hill, and Maryam Shaaban.
In this project, we chose to analyze locations of public health facilities and clinics in relation to crime rates and median household income across the city of Chicago.

We are doing a comparison between ease of access to healthcare facilities, access to public or private healthcare by neighborhood and crime rate. 
The data we used for this project are listed below:
Crime data (City of Chicago Data Portal, “Crimes 2001 to Present”)
Primary care community health facility locations (City of Chicago Data Portal, “Public Health Services- Chicago Primary Care Community Health Centers”)
Mental health, STI, and WIC clinic locations (City of Chicago Data Portal, “Chicago Department of Public Health Clinic Locations”)
Income data by community area (Chicago Magazine The Geography of Money)
Community area boundaries (City of Chicago Data Portal, “Boundaries- Community Areas (current)”

The first null hypothesis we formulated is that we expect there will be no correlation between the number of public healthcare facilities in a community area and the amount of crime experienced in a community area. Alternatively, we hyptohesize that there will be a negative correlation between the number of public healthcare facilities in a community area and the amount of crime experienced in a community area.
The second null hypothesis we formulated is that there will be no correlation between the average median household income of a community area and the number of public healthcare facilities in a community area. Alternatively, we expect that there will be a positive correlation between the average median household income of a community area and the number of public healthcare facilities in a community area.

We found that a relationship did exist between Chicago median household income and specific types of crime, such as Assault and Robbery, but that relationship was not apparent with crime in general and other specific types of crime, such as Deceptive Practices. We also found that a relationship existed between Chicago median household income and the average amount of narcotics-related and homicide-related crimes in 2021. 

In conclusion, we fail to reject the null hypothesis that there is no correlation between median household income and number of arrests in the year 2021, according to our data sets. However, when you breakdown arrests to specific kinds of crime a correlation does appear depending on the crime. Additionally, we reject the null hypothesis that there is no correlation between the median household income of a community area and the number of public health centers in a community area. However, the correlation here also shows that there is a negative correlation between the median household income of a community area and the number of public health centers in the community areas.

Finally, some limitations we experienced were that we relied heavily on data sourced from the Census. This data is collected every 10 years, and is not always the most up-to-date or representative of current trends or observations. Another limitation we noticed was that our facility and clinic location data are from 2019 and 2017 respectively-- While this is not too outdated, there could be new sites not accounted for or closures in existing locations that we are unaware of, which could ultimately affect our results. The last limitation we noticed was that in our choroplath maps we visualizd crime as a raw total number of incidents or cases. It may have been more effective to instead visualize and analyze crime as 'crime per capita', as this is more representative of crime relative to each community area and could also appear more normally distributed.
