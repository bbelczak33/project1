In this project, the goal of my work was to analyze the relationship between median household income for each of 73 community areas in Chicago and the average incidence of homicide-related or narcotics-related crimes. From my analysis, I found that median household income had an effect on the average incidence of each type of crime. These results are shown below. Significance threshold: P < 0.05.
